leetcode 142
Given the head of a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.
There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer.
Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to (0-indexed).
It is -1 if there is no cycle. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.
Do not modify the linked list.
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
 3->2->0->-4--|
    ^         |
    |_________|
Output: tail connects to node index 1 i.e, 2
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
    1->2
    ^  |
    |__|
Output: tail connects to node index 0 i.e, 1
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
    1->null
Output: no cycle i.e, null
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.

    explanation of step2:find the start of cycle:
    This works because of the following mathematical reasoning:

    Definitions:
    Let the distance from the head to the start of the cycle be ùëò
    Let the distance from the start of the cycle to the meeting point be ùëö
    Let the length of the cycle be ùê∂
    Distance Traveled:
    By the time the slow pointer and fast pointer meet:
    The slow pointer has traveled k+m steps.
    The fast pointer has traveled 2(k+m) steps (because it moves twice as fast).
    The fast pointer has also completed one or more full cycles in the loop:
    2(k+m) = k+m+nC
    Where n is the number of full cycles completed by the fast pointer.
    Simplifying:
    k+m=nC

    Key Insight:
    Rearrange
    k+m=nC to get:
    k=nC‚àím
    This means the distance from the head to the start of the cycle (k) is equal to the distance from the meeting point to
    the start of the cycle (nC‚àím, which is a multiple of the cycle length).

    Resetting the Slow Pointer:
    When the slow pointer is reset to the head:
    Both the slow pointer and fast pointer move one step at a time.
    The slow pointer travels k steps to reach the start of the cycle.
    The fast pointer, starting from the meeting point, also travels k steps to reach the start of the cycle
    (because the remaining distance from the meeting point to the cycle start i.e,(nC-m) is also k).
    They Meet at the Start of the Cycle:
    Therefore, the node where they meet is the start of the cycle.
