/*
Alexa has two stacks of non-negative integers, stack a[n] and stack b[m]  where index 0 denotes the top of the stack. Alexa challenges Nick to play the following game:

In each move, Nick can remove one integer from the top of either stack a or stack b .
Nick keeps a running sum of the integers he removes from the two stacks.
Nick is disqualified from the game if, at any point, his running sum becomes greater than some integer maxSum given at the beginning of the game.
Nick's final score is the total number of integers he has removed from the two stacks.
Given a,b, and maxSum for g games, find the maximum possible score Nick can achieve.

Example
a=[1,2,3,4,5]
b=[6,7,8,9]

The maximum number of values Nick can remove is 4. There are two sets of choices with this result.

Remove 1,2,3,4 from a with a sum of 10.
Remove 1,2,3 from a and 6 from b with a sum of 12.
Function Description
Complete the twoStacks function in the editor below.

twoStacks has the following parameters: - int maxSum: the maximum allowed sum
- int a[n]: the first stack
- int b[m]: the second stack

Returns
- int: the maximum number of selections Nick can make

sample input:
1                               (no. of games)
5 4 10                          (size of a,size of b,maxSum)
4 2 4 6 1                       (first array)
2 1 8 5                         (second array)

sample output:
4

we use recursion to solve this so we'll check with each top element and go on adding and returning when sum reaches >maxSum
and finally the no.of.steps-1 will be answer -1 coz no.of.steps the sum would be >maxSum so we need when !>maxSum
